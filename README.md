## Fiber OS Atlas

Fiber OS Atlas is a continuation of the original Fiber OS by Scratch user N25Games. It is based on Fiber8 (ironically hosted on the Scratch account Fiber7) and aims to continue the original Fiber OS by adding new features and modifying existing ones.

Current Version: 9.0 Alpha 1 (https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/475131777/)

As of now it is still being worked on.
### Changes since Fiber8:

```markdown
- Revamped icons.
- Smoothed out home screen animations.
- Improved music functionality.
- Partially implemented dark mode.
- Implemented adaptive background (sorta).
- Removed access to the Tutorial via Settings (It's kind of unneeded, everyone knows how the old versions work by now, and nothing really changed...)
- More to come in the future!
```
### To-do:

```markdown
- Make Fiber Bar be on the right where the Clock is.
- Add a dark mode.
- Adaptive Background similar to MacOS Mojave (changes with modes).
- Fix a few bugs and remove unneeded sprites.
- Fix issues with Settings after restart.
- Add a boot up and shutdown animation.
- Add a better assistant.
- Fix the Calculator app.
- Make the Calender app something more than an empty screen.
- Add some games!
- Fix the Camera app.
- Fix issues with Settings after closing while in Fiber Bar.
```
