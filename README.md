## Fiber OS

Fiber OS is a continuation of the original Fiber OS by Scratch user N25Games. It is based on Fiber8 (ironically hosted on the Scratch account Fiber7) and aims to continue the original Fiber OS by adding new features and modifying existing ones.

Current (unreleased) Version: Fiber OS 9 (codenamed Atlas)

As of now it is still being worked on.
### Changes since Fiber8:

```markdown
- Revamped icons.
- Changed Settings animation.
- Fiber Bar is now on the right where the Clock is.
- Added a dark mode.
- Fiber Bar now moves some content to the left when it appears. 
- Adaptive Background similar to MacOS Mojave (changes with modes).
- Fixed a few bugs and removed unnecessary/unused sprites.
- Music functionality is restored.
- Fixed issues with Settings after restart.
- More to come in the future!
```
### To-do:

```markdown
- Add a boot up and shutdown animation.
- Add a better assistant.
- Fix the Calculator app.
- Make the Calender app something more than an empty screen.
- Add some games!
- Fix the Camera app.
- Fix issues with Settings after closing while in Fiber Bar.
```
